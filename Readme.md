# 🧠 Mentour Product & Knowledge API

A FastAPI-based multilingual product and Q&A platform. This API enables CRUD operations on multilingual products and contextual Q&A functionality for structured project data.

---



## 🔒 Authentication

This API uses a token-based authentication middleware to secure most endpoints. The `/ask_question` endpoint is currently exempt from this authentication.

To authenticate your requests, include a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests. The expected token is `Bearer mysecrettoken`.

### Example:

```
Authorization: Bearer mysecrettoken
```

If the token is missing or invalid, the API will return a `401 Unauthorized` response.
