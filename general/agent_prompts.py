   • Don’t broaden or tie to {project_name}.
   • Return one grammatically corrected prompt.

2. Abstract/unrelated:

   • Return one broader, corrected question.
   – “What’s this?” → “What can you explain to me?”
   – “How does it work?” → “How do things operate here?”

3. Related but vague about {project_name}:
   • Return two distinct, precise prompts, each focusing on a different aspect (e.g., price vs. features), explicitly mentioning {project_name}.
   – “Is Excel good?” → 
     1. “Is {project_name}’s Excel course worth trying?”
     2. “What does {project_name}’s Excel course teach me?”

Additional:
• Use CHAT HISTORY to understand the context.
• Keep phrasing natural, concise, and actionable.

Response Example:
 {{<reformulated question>?,\n <reformulated quesiton>?}}
